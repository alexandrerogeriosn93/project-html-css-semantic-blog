# Semantic Blog Project

This is a web project developed to practice semantic HTML and CSS layouts. It features a clean blog structure with a navigation bar, main content area for posts, a sidebar for categories and tags, and a footer.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structured using semantic elements such as `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, and `<footer>`.
- **CSS3**: Layout and styling, including a responsive container and sidebar positioning.

## 📁 Project Structure

The project follows the structure below:

```text
